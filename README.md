# Windmills
Energy can be produced from wind using windmills. Choosing a site for a wind farm (i.e. the location of the windmills), however, can be a multimillion dollar gamble. If wind is inadequate at the site, then the energy produced over the lifetime of the wind farm can be much less than the cost of building the operation. Hence, accurate prediction of wind speed at a candidate site can be an important component in the decision to build or not to build. Since energy produced varies as the square of the wind speed, even small errors in prediction can have serious consequences. One possible solution to help predict windspeed at a candidate site is to use windspeed at a nearby reference site. A reference site is a nearby location where the windspeed is already being monitored and should, theoretically, be similar to the candidate site. Using information from the reference site will allow windmill companies to know the windspeed at the candidate site without going through a costly data collection period if the reference site is a good predictor.
